Warning: Really messy code!

We are a group of bachelor students from Aalborg University, Copenhagen. We are doing some research on Artificial Intelligence and player engagement in video games.
We have made a simple prototype game which we would like you to try. A game session takes close to 15 minutes, during which you asked to answer a questionnaire.
If you are interested in testing, don't read the comments, try it with a fresh mind. And if you have tried please don't spoil anything in the comments.
Lastly we assure you that all questionnaire answers are fully anonymous, and are solely used for the purpose of this bachelor project.

Read Before you play
-------------------
Game requires a mouse to be playable.We would like to ask you to play the game alone, and without guidance.
We would also like to ask you to play the game with sound.
When you start the game, the game will finish when you have played enough - So try to keep playing until you get the questionnaire.
If you have played through the prototype and are still interested in trying. Then you can start it again, and you should be able to play for unlimited time without having to answer anything.
Lastly, we are not really interested in direct issues with the game. You can post them here, but this is not our primary interest. It is good to know future works, so we'll still appreciate it!

Known issues
------------
Sometimes characters won't talk to you - This can sometimes be solved by moving way, and trying again later.
Sometimes all characters will stop moving, talking and generally functioning, this is usually an indication of a crash - Restart the game
There is generally a lot of bugs - But you should still be able to finish the prototype.
